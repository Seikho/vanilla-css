##### Vanilla CSS has been tested thoroughly and is compatible with the following frameworks  
Semantic UI - Bootstrap - Foundation - UIKit - 960 Grid System - Skeleton - Kube - Yaml - YUI CSS - Boilerplate - Helium  
  
However, it's generally accepted that Vanilla-CSS can outperform any of the above frameworks.  It also has a much smaller footprint.  Just take a look at the file size comparisons.
